### How can I resize an existing instance?

Although the `Resize Instance` option does appear in **Horizon**, this functionality currently is not supported. If you need to extend an instance's size, the recommended path is to take a snapshot of the instance and redeploy that snapshot into a new, larger flavor.



### How can I start up an instance on a specific host?
This functionality is supported through the **OpenStack API**.  Please see [_How to deploy an instance to a specific hypervisor node_](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/nova/deploy-to-specific-hypervisor/) for more details.



### I have a new cloud, and there are already two projects in place. What are these?

The `admin` and `service` projects are created to support the underlying operation of your **IBM Blue Box Cloud**. These projects should be left in place. Do not modify or deploy them.


### Which ports/URLs etc are publicly accessible on my Blue Box Cloud, and for what purpose?

The ports that are open through the firewall to your IBM Blue Box Cloud are:

```

80 - horizon (OpenStack Web Portal)
443 - horizon (OpenStack Web Portal)
5000 - keystone (OpenStack Authentication API)
6080 - nova-novnc (OpenStack VNC Console)
8000 - heat (OpenStack CloudFormation API)
8004 - heat (OpenStack Orchestration API)
8774 - nova (OpenStack Compute API)
8776 - cinder (OpenStack Block Storage API)
9292 - glance (OpenStack Image API)
9696 - neutron (OpenStack Network API)
35357 - keystone-admin (OpenStack Authentication Admin API)
```

Three additional ports are enabled if you've requested Swift (OpenStack Object Storage) to be configured on your cluster: `6000, 6001, 6002`

All of these ports are available via your custom Horizon URL.

### How can I measure IO Operations Per Second on an instance's or a volume's drive?


You can use any number of tools to measure disk performance.

A particularly easy to use python script for measuring IOPS by Benjamin Schweizer, with instructions and example results is available:

`https://benjamin-schweizer.de/measuring-disk-io-performance.html`

The latest version of this script currently [is available here.](https://benjamin-schweizer.de/files/iops/iops-2011-02-11)

Usage is as follows:
   ` iops [-n|--num_threads threads] [-t|--time time] <device>`

    threads := number of concurrent io threads, default 1
    time    := time in seconds, default 10
    device  := some block device, like /dev/sda or \\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0

examples:

    iops /dev/sda
    iops -n 8 -t 2 /dev/disk0
    iops --num_threads 1 --time 2 /dev/md1
    iops --num_threads 16 --time 2 /dev/md1

### When using security groups, how can I log refused TCP connections to forbidden ports?

If you want to log refused TCP connections to forbidden ports, you'll need to open up security groups and run iptables with logging on the instances.
